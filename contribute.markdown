## Adding content

1. Fork the [repo][].
2. Copy `template.md` to a new file.
3. Write your content. Commit.
4. Send a pull request.

## Notes

* You can write in [Markdown][].
* If your "recipe" has any dependencies, include them in `deps`. You can refer to other pages in the repo by writing their filename (without the extension), e.g. `deps: [install-homebrew]`
* Content enclosed in ` ``` ` is important. When other pages list your page as a `dep`, the content between the ` ``` ` will be included on their page.
* Don't forget to add yourself as a contributor so you can get credit! You can write your name, or you can write your Github page URL.
* You retain copyright to your work. By contributing a guide, you agree to publish under the [Creative Commons Attribution-Share-Alike ](license) license.

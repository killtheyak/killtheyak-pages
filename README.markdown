2. Copy `template.md` to a new file.
3. Write your content. Commit.
4. Send a pull request.

Some things to note:

* You can write in [Markdown][].
* If your "recipe" has any dependencies, include them in `deps`. You can refer to other pages in the repo by writing their filename (without the extension), e.g. `deps: [install-homebrew]`
* Content enclosed in triple-backticks is important. When other pages list your page as a `dep`, the content between the triple-backticks will be included on their page.

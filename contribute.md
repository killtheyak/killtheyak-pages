title: Contribute

1. Clone the [repo][].
2. Copy `TEMPLATE.md`.
3. Write your content. Commit.
4. Send a pull request.

Some things to note:

* You can write in [Markdown][].
* If your "recipe" has any dependencies, include them in `deps`. You can refer to other pages in the repo by writing their filename (without the extension), e.g. `deps: [install-homebrew]`
* Content enclosed in ` ``` ` is important. When other pages list your page as a `dep`, the content between the ` ``` ` will be included on their page.
* Don't forget to add yourself as a contributor so you can get credit! You can write your name, or you can write your Github page URL.
